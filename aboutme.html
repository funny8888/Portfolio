   <p class = "text_paragraph"> Hi! My name is Serina. I live in Fremont, CA and recently graduated from 10th grade. 
    I'm spending my summer with Girls Who Code at Facebook for 7 weeks, and it's been very fun! 
    Recently, I've learned how to use Scratch and programmed a video game with my friends. 
    I've really enjoyed in learning how to code with the help of my instructors.  
    I am also a second degree black belt in tae kwon do. Tae kwon do is my passion - 
    I've spent 6 years pursuing a black belt and finally reached my goal  18 months ago, 
    when I received my first degree black belt. My favorite foods include burritos, sushi, and lasagna. 
    However, I don't really like foods that include nuts (I'm allergic), and some Indian foods like chana masala. 
    I prefer dogs over any other animal, including cats. Actually, my dog's name is Clyde, and he's part poodle 
    (the most superior breed *smirk face*).  Purple, blue, and green are my favorite colors, 
    while I don't like yellow or orange very much. If I could live in an alternate universe, 
    I would chose to live in the Harry Potter universe, but definetly not the Hunger Games universe.  
    I'd never survive - I literally have no survival skills or unique abilities, 
    unless you count my ability to solely consume Hot Cheetos for days on end. </p>
